URGENT REDIS IS FIXED but DATABASE_URL IS STILL MISSING!

I have auto-fixed the REDIS_URL for you directly in .env.
However, the DATABASE_URL is still 'place:holder'.

1. Open .env
2. CHANGE DATABASE_URL (Get it from Neon Console)
3. CHANGE TWILIO Keys (Get them from Twilio)
4. Restart 'npm run dev'
